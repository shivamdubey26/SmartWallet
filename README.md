# Contract Wallet
This is a smart contract-based wallet that allows you to securely store and manage your digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain. The wallet is built using Solidity, and can be accessed using any Ethereum wallet or dApp browser that supports interacting with smart contracts.

## Features
1.Secure storage of Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens

2.Transfer of assets to other Ethereum addresses

3.Approval of third-party contracts to spend your assets

4.View your transaction history

5.Set a daily withdrawal limit

6.Recover your wallet using a seed phrase
## Getting Started
To use this wallet, you will need to connect to it using an Ethereum wallet or dApp browser. Here's how to get started:

1.Make sure you have an Ethereum wallet or dApp browser that supports interacting with smart contracts. Examples include MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, and Mist.

2.Open your Ethereum wallet or dApp browser, and connect to the Ethereum network where the wallet contract is deployed.

3.Copy the contract address and ABI into your wallet or dApp browser to interact with the contract. The contract address and ABI can be found in the contract.json file.

4.Once you've connected to the wallet contract, you can start managing your assets.
## Security
This wallet has been designed with security in mind. Here are some of the key security features:

1.All transactions are processed on the Ethereum blockchain, which is secured by decentralized consensus.

2.Your private keys are never stored on any server or device, and are used only to sign transactions locally.

3.Withdrawals can be restricted to a daily limit set by the wallet owner, to prevent unauthorized access.

4.The wallet can be recovered using a seed phrase, which is generated during wallet creation.
